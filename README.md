# FilmHive

FilmHive is a movie information platform, a powerful online database of movie details meticulously designed to give users a seamless movie exploration experience. The website boasts a collection of details about virtually any movie that has ever hit the screens, provided via the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs).

This project is a collaborative work between Raman, who was responsible for the backend functionalities, and Devesh, who brilliantly handled the design aspects of the project. The website showcases trending movies on the homepage, a search feature for movie exploration, and a list of top-rated movies for movie enthusiasts who are in search of great film recommendations.

The website's design is fully responsive and adapts smoothly to any device, ensuring that users enjoy a fluid, consistent browsing experience irrespective of their device's screen size.
